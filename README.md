# Nail

## Summary

**WIP**

Nail is a next-generation language inspired by Rust, but with a built-in garbage collector.  
Like Rust, we aim for ‚Äúif it compiles, it will likely run reliably,‚Äù while recognizing that no language can guarantee complete freedom from bugs.  
By merging Rust‚Äôs robust type system with a GC-based memory model‚Äîand adopting certain TypeScript-like features for front-end development‚ÄîNail strives to be a practical choice for everything from server-side projects to web front ends.  
We also provide an `async/await` concurrency model to simplify asynchronous programming across various use cases (excluding embedded targets).

- **Base**: Rust
- **Memory Management**: GC + possible ownership-based optimizations
- **Type System**: Rust-inspired, with TypeScript-like additions
- **Concurrency**: async/await

> **Note**: While our core vision remains steady, the specific implementation details may evolve significantly.

## Target Domains

Nail is an experimental, GC-enabled language inspired by Rust. While still in early development, our primary focus is on:

- **Console (CLI) Applications**  
- **Desktop Applications**  
- **Web Back-End**  
- **Web Front-End** (e.g., compiling to WebAssembly)  
- **Mobile (planned)** ‚Äì taking cues from Dart/Flutter

> **Note**: We do **not** plan to support heavily resource-constrained embedded devices.

## Additional Concepts

- **Default GC with Ownership-Based Optimization**  
  By default, we plan to rely on a garbage collector. However, if the compiler can determine an object‚Äôs lifetime or ownership precisely, it may skip the GC step for those objects to improve performance.

- **Keyword & Default Arguments**  
  We plan to support **keyword arguments** and **default arguments** for better readability‚Äîespecially useful when dealing with UI-like or large-parameter-function scenarios.

- **Async/Await Syntax**  
  We aim to provide an `async/await` style similar to C# or JavaScript. Since this language is GC-based, we will avoid exposing detailed lifetime mechanics, offering a more high-level asynchronous programming experience.

- **Trait-Based Partial Subtyping (Low Priority)**  
  We are exploring a design that automatically implements a trait if a type structurally meets the trait‚Äôs requirements. However, this is a **low-priority** feature for now and may change or be dropped.

- **No Macros (For Now)**  
  We have decided not to include macros in the early stages of development, aiming to keep the language simple and maintainable. We may revisit macros in the future.

- **Potential Dynamic Sections**  
  To handle unknown (JSON-like) data, we are considering ‚Äúdynamic sections‚Äù in which static type checks are relaxed, and runtime checks ensure safety. This idea is still under consideration.

- **WebAssembly Compilation**  
  We plan to use LLVM as the primary backend for WebAssembly. We will explore optimizations and suitable GC strategies to ensure high performance on WASM.

- **AI-Friendly Language Design**  
  We would like to consider language specifications that are compatible with recent generation AI.

### 9. Concurrency and Parallelism

‚ùå
In this language, calling an asynchronous function immediately starts its process.
You have two ways to handle the result:

1. **Immediate Await (`.await`)**  
   The function call returns a value, waiting right away:
   ```pseudo
   let result = fetch_data("https://example.com").await;
   // Execution continues after fetch_data completes
   ```

2. **Async First, Await Later (`.async` ‚Üí `.await`)**  
   Start the process and receive a `Future`, then wait for it when you need:
   ```pseudo
   let future = fetch_data("https://example.org").async;
   // ... do other work ...
   let result = future.await;
   ```

#### Benefits
- **Clarity**: You explicitly show whether you wait immediately or retrieve the result later.  
- **Flexibility**: You can launch multiple async tasks and await them at the right time.  
- **Error Prevention**: The compiler warns if you ignore a returned `Future` without handling or awaiting it.

Use `.await` to get the result right away, or `.async` when you need concurrent execution and plan to await later.

```rust
async fn main() {
    let result = async {
        let a = async { 1 };
        let b = fetch_data().async;
        a.await + b.await
    }.await; // 3
}
async fn fetch_data() -> i64 {
    let data = async {
        // fetch data from the network
        2
    }.await;
    return data;
}
```
